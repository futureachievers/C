Operators
1+2 => 1,2 are operands
+ is operator

Arthmatic operators
Relational operators
Logical operators
BitWise operators
Increment/Decrement operators
Assignment operators
Conditional operators

Arthmatic operators
+, -, *, /, % - Modulo operator which gives remainder
4/2 = 2 - that is the result of division
4%2 = 0 - reminder 
1%2 = 1
3%2 = 1
75%5 = 0
74%5 = 4
74/5 = 14
Relational operators
> < <= >= 
== - Equality check 
!= - Inequality check

Logical operators
&& - Logical AND - if all the conditions true then only the whole condition is true
|| - Logical OR - if one of the conditions are true then the whole condition is true.
! = If the condition is true then result is false and if the condition is false and the result is true

BitWise operators
&, |, ^, << , >> , ~
& - Bit wise AND 
| - Bitwise OR
^ - Bitwise XOR
<<  - Left shift
>>  - right shift
~ - Negation

Increment/Decrement operators
++, --
++x -> pre Increment
x++ -> post Increment
--x -> pre Decrement
x-- -> post Decrement

Assignment operators
=, +=, -=. *=, /= , %=

int x = 10, y =20;
x= y; =>   x = 20 , y = 20//asign contents of y to x // x == y
x = 25; x = 25 y =20 
y = x; x = 25 y =25

Conditional operators
(cond)? True expression : False expression;
int a = 2, b =5;
int max =0;
max = (a>b)?a:b;
